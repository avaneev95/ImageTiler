The generated tiles can be displayed using Google Maps, Leaflet or OpenLayers.

It also provides a simple preview file using Leaflet library.

5. Generate tiles

## Settings
* `Tile size` - the size of smallest image chunk, default is 256.
* `Max zoom level` - the max allowed zoom level of the image. Can be the integer number between 1 and 10, by default application will calculate the optimal zoom level based on image size and tile size.
* `Output directory` - the directory where generated tiles will be saved. If the directory doesn't exist, it will be created. The tiles wil be placed in a `map` subfolder.
